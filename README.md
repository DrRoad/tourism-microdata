# This repository contains code which creates a database of MBIE's tourism microdata
This repository contains [R|https://www.rstudio.com/] code for creating a MySQL database and populating this with tourism microdata. 

## A working MySQL database and RMySQL connection is needed
In order to use this database you will need a working connection to a MySQL server that can be accessed via RMySQL, and credentials that allow you to create databases and tables. The script could be easily adapted for other database platforms, pull requests will be considered.

## The main file is /create-database/create_database_mysql.R
The main file in the repository is an R script under the create-database folder. This script downloads about 100MB of tourism microdata from the MBIE website, creates a database called 'production' on a MySQL connection and populates the database with the tourism microdata.  The intention is to re-create the MBIE environment as closely as possible.  The microdata CSVs that are downloaded are dumps from the analysis-ready views in the "TRED" database in the MBIE environment.
